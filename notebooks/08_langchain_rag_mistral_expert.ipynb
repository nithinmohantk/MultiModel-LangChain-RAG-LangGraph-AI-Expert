    "## LangChain RAG Expert with LangGraph State Management (using Mistral AI)\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build a sophisticated AI agent using LangChain and LangGraph, now integrated with Mistral AI API for the Large Language Model. The agent will act as a \"Helpful Historical Expert\" with the following key enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The agent will query a local knowledge base (a text file) to retrieve relevant information before generating a response, ensuring factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph for State Management: We will use LangGraph to define a stateful workflow, allowing the agent to manage its internal state (e.g., current question, retrieved context) and execute steps like retrieval and response generation conditionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Guardrails: The detailed system prompt from prompt.txt will continue to guide the AI's persona, tone, and adherence to safety and scope constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Gemini Integration: The core language model for generation will be Google Gemini.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the system with both an on-topic historical question (which should leverage RAG) and an off-topic question (which should trigger the guardrails).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Why the Leaning Tower of Pisa Leans\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Construction and Soil Issues:** Construction of the tower began in August 1173. The tower was designed to be perfectly vertical, but it started to lean by the time the third floor was completed in 1178.\n",
      "- **Soft Ground:** The soil beneath the tower is composed of soft clay, fine sand, and shells, which could not adequately support the structure's weight. This instability caused the tower to begin tilting to the north initially.\n",
      "- **Construction Halts:** Construction was halted for nearly a century, allowing the soil to settle and compact. When construction resumed in 1272, engineers attempted to correct the tilt by building the upper floors with one side taller than the other. This adjustment caused the tower to lean in the opposite direction (south), creating a slight curve in the structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Efforts to Stabilize the Tower\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Early Attempts:**\n",
      "  - In 1838, architect Alessandro Gherardesca dug a pathway around the base to expose the foundation, which inadvertently caused the tower to lean even more.\n",
      "  - In 1934, Benito Mussolini ordered the tower to be straightened by pouring concrete into the foundations, which also worsened the lean.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Modern Stabilization (1990-2001):**\n",
      "  - An international committee of experts, led by Michele Jamiolkowski, undertook a significant stabilization project.\n",
      "  - **Counterweights:** Initially, 600 tonnes of lead ingots were placed on the north side of the base to counteract the lean.\n",
      "  - **Soil Extraction:** More effectively, soil was carefully removed from underneath the north side of the foundations. This caused the tower to slowly settle back towards the north, reducing its tilt by about 45 cm (17.7 inches). This brought the lean back to what it was in 1838.\n",
      "  - The tower was reopened to the public in December 2001 and is now considered stable for at least another 200 years.\n",
