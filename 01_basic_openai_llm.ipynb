      "The primary reason for the Leaning Tower of Pisa's tilt is its unstable foundation, which was a combination of the soft ground on which it was built and poor foundational design. Construction on the tower began in 1173 but was halted several times due to wars and financial difficulties. As a result, the tower's foundation settled unevenly on the soft ground, causing the lean to develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the centuries, various engineering efforts have been made to stabilize the tower and prevent its collapse. Between 1990 and 2001, a major restoration project was undertaken to reduce the lean and ensure the tower's long-term stability. Engineers worked to straighten the tower by removing soil from underneath the raised end, adjusting the angle of the tower slightly to reduce the lean. This effort was successful, reducing the lean by about 18 inches and ensuring the tower's stability for at least another 200 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other measures taken to stabilize the tower include the installation of counterweights on the north side to offset the lean, strengthening the foundation, and monitoring the tower's tilt through ongoing efforts such as ground sensors and computer models. These engineering efforts have not only preserved the historical landmark but also ensured the safety of visitors and the surrounding area.\n"

The tower's construction began in 1173 on soft ground consisting of clay, fine sand, and shells, which was unable to fully support the weight of the tower. As construction progressed, the tilt became noticeable, leading to interruptions in the construction process in an attempt to correct the lean.\n",

      "Various engineering efforts have been made over the centuries to stabilize the Leaning Tower of Pisa. In the initial construction phase, the tower's upper floors were built with one side taller than the other to try to compensate for the lean. Further attempts were made during later stages of construction, such as adjusting the height of the columns and adding more weight to the higher side to counterbalance the lean.\n",

In the 1990s, a comprehensive project was undertaken to stabilize the tower and prevent further leaning. This involved removing soil from underneath the foundation on the leaning side and anchoring the tower with steel cables to prevent it from toppling over. Additionally, the soil around the tower was stabilized and compacted to reduce further settlement.\n",
