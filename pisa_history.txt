The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of Pisa, Italy. It is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry.

The tower is known for its unintended tilt to one side, which began during construction in the 12th century due to soft ground that could not properly support the structure's weight. Construction began in August 1173. The tower was designed to be perfectly vertical, but it began to lean by the time the third floor was built in 1178. The soft soil, composed of clay, fine sand, and shells, was unstable. This initial lean was towards the north.

Construction was halted for almost a century, which allowed the underlying soil to settle and compact, preventing the tower from toppling. When construction resumed in 1272, under Giovanni di Simone, the engineers tried to compensate for the tilt by building the upper floors with one side taller than the other. This caused the tower to start leaning in the opposite direction (south), creating a slight curve. Construction was again halted in 1284.

The seventh floor was completed in 1319, and the bell-chamber was finally added in 1372 by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who incorporated Gothic elements. The tower has 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side, as some steps had to be removed due to the lean.

Over the centuries, various efforts were made to correct or prevent the collapse of the tower. In 1838, architect Alessandro Gherardesca dug a pathway around the base to make the base visible, which caused the tower to lean even more. Benito Mussolini ordered that the tower be returned to a vertical position, and concrete was poured into the foundations in 1934, which also worsened the lean.

The most significant stabilization efforts took place from 1990 to 2001. An international committee of experts, led by Michele Jamiolkowski, undertook a major project. They used counterweights (600 tonnes of lead ingots) on the north side of the base and, more effectively, soil extraction. Soil was carefully removed from underneath the north side of the foundations, causing the tower to slowly settle back towards the north, reducing its tilt by about 45 cm (17.7 inches). This brought the lean back to what it was in 1838. The tower was reopened to the public in December 2001.

Today, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is considered stable for at least another 200 years. Its unique tilt continues to attract millions of tourists worldwide.
